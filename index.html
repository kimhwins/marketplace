            <h3>👀 OVERVIEW</h3>
            <h2>
              While I was at Facebook Marketplace, <br>
              I worked with the Seller team to make it easier for sellers to <span class="highlight-text2">promote their
                products to buyers.</span>
            </h2>
            <p>For almost a year, we focused on building 3 new major features in this space: <span
                class="bold highlight-text-p">Promotions, Flash Sales,
                and
                Virtual Pop-up Shops.</span> Plus, I designed a few North Stars peeking into the future of an expanded
              promotion
              program for
              sellers of all sizes!

            <h3>📚 BACKGROUND</h3>
            <h2>
              Facebook Marketplace is where people go <br>to find good deals.
            </h2>
            <p>We’re a little different from other shopping sites like Etsy, Nordstrom, or Sephora, where people are
              looking to be
              inspired to buy the next new and shiny thing. Instead, we’ve seen in research that <span
                class="bold highlight-text-p">Marketplace shoppers come to our platform looking for value,</span> like a
              great deal on a preowned desk or a vintage dress.
              <br>
              <br>
              On the other side of things, <span class="bold highlight-text-p">Marketplace <span
                  style="font-family: 'Kollektif-BoldItalic';">sellers</span> have pretty obvious wants: to sell more of
                their items, and to get more money.</span>
            <!-- <div style="margin: 40px 0; background-color: #F6F6F6; height: 350px; width: 100%"></div> -->
                                                                        <div class="half-row-2" style="flex-direction: column;">
                                                                          <img class="img-33" src="images/graphic 1.png">
                                                                        
                                                                        </div>

            </p>
            <p>Both of these groups are crucially important to us as a product team, of course—without either of them,
              we would have no
              Marketplace at all!</p>
          </section>

          <section data-aos="fade-down" id="problem">
            <h3>🤔 PROBLEM</h3>
            <h2>
              Buyers want more value on Marketplace. <br>
              Sellers want to sell more. <br> <br>
              Letting sellers put their items on sale solves both— <br>
              except Marketplace didn’t have that feature yet!
            </h2>
            <p>
              <span class="bold highlight-text-p">By letting sellers put their items on sale,</span> we can kill two
              birds with one stone: give buyers even more deals to buy,
              and get sellers even more sales.
              <br><br>
              This may sound like an obvious tablestakes feature, but surprisingly, Marketplace didn’t have a way to do
              this in bulk.
              Sellers could only reduce the prices of their items one by one, and that’s no fun for anyone trying to
              make a sale with
              more than a dozen.
              <br><br>
              (Unsurprisingly, sales were a big feature requested in our user feedback groups on Facebook. We certainly
              still had a
              lot of catching up to do.)
            </p>
          </section>


          <section data-aos="fade-down" id="users">
            <h3>😊😄 USERS</h3>
            <h2>
              But not all sellers are made the same: <br>
              introducing your local small businesses <br>
              & the Big Brands.
            </h2>
            <p>While all sellers share a want of selling more, they can have very distinct individual needs & ways of
              operating. Our
              past research showed a few distinct archetypes: hobbyists, SMBs, and Big Brands.
                                                            <div class="half-row-2">
                                                              <img class="img-33" src="images/graphic 2.png">
                                                            
                                                            </div>
            </p>

            <p>
              Since the current way of putting items on sale (slashing the price of individual items) works for
              hobbyists, who have
              very few items, <span class="bold highlight-text-p">our focus here was on those SMBs and Big
                Brands.</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              Along with their very different ways of operation, these 2 groups also have very different approaches to
              sales—
                                                            <div class="half-row-2" style="flex-direction: column; margin-bottom: 70px; margin-top: 50px;">
                                                              <img class="img-33" src="images/graphic 3.png">
                                                            
                                                            </div>

            </p>
            <p>Looking at all their distinct differences, we knew they needed distinct solutions, too. We decided to
              build 3 new
              features to fit their needs: <span class="bold highlight-text-p">Seller Promotions and Virtual Pop-up
                Shops for SMBs, and Flash Sales for the Big Brands.</span>
            <!-- <div style="margin: 40px 0; background-color: #F6F6F6; height: 450px; width: 100%"></div> -->
            </p>
            <p>(While we zeroed in on these 2 user groups, it’s worth mentioning that supporting sellers on Marketplace
              always means
              balancing the needs & wants of buyers, all sellers archetypes, and of course Marketplace as a business,
              all at the
              same.)</p>

            <h3>🏷️ SELLER PROMOTIONS</h3>
            <h2>
              Seller Promotions was designed to be a <br>
              <span class="bold highlight-text2">quick, easy, & versatile addition</span> to the existing Marketplace
              seller toolkit.
            </h2>
            <p>
              Most of our SMBs are relatively new to business operations, and they’re exactly what our in-app
              Marketplace seller
              experience is designed for — making the process of selling as lightweight and easy breezy as possible,
              while being
              versatile enough to cater to the most common use cases. <br><br>

              And so while our team’s plan was to implement all types of
              common sales & promotions, in standard MVP fashion, <span class="bold highlight-text-p">we started with
                the most common of them all: flat discounts,</span> ie.
              your classic 50% off or $15 off.<br><br>

              After close collaboration with our content designer, a few design crits and XFN
              reviews, and discussion with a designer from the Buyer team, we finalized a straightforward & simplistic
              flow for MVP,
              fully using existing components from the Facebook Design System.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>
              Our MVP for Seller Promotions was simple.<br>
              Flat discounts, no bells and whistles.<br>
              (all that to come later.)

              These were pretty simple additions to the existing flow, although Bulk Discounts had an added layer. Sellers often knew
              they wanted an item to have a bulk discount from the very beginning, while making the item’s listing, so we needed to
              add it into the listing creation flow too.

            <h3>🛍️ VIRTUAL POP-UP SHOPS</h3>
            <h2>
              With Virtual Pop-up Shops, we could feature our sellers in an <span class="bold highlight-text2">eye-catching, editorial way,</span> and give buyers <span class="bold highlight-text2">a reason to

            <p>
              When it comes to shopping on Marketplace, buyers usually don’t know who they’re buying from, whether it’s a hobbyist or
              SMB. It’s why they feel more confident shopping from trusted Big Brands, leading to more sales and our platform giving
              them more real estate and more spotlights.
              <br>
              <br>
              
              Virtual Pop-up Shops let us shine the spotlight on our SMBs instead and
              support them by helping them gain more buyer trust. <span class="bold highlight-text-p">By highlighting qualified shops in a Marketplace-curated collection,
              we hoped buyers would trust the Facebook name and by extension, the featured shops.</span>

            <h3>⚡️ FLASH SALES</h3>
            <h2>
              Flash Sales started out barebones, <br>
               but evolved into a storefront that landed <br>
               <span class="bold highlight-text2" style="margin-left:-5px;">big wins for our Big Brands.</span></h2>
            <p>
              Flash Sales started out as a sudden top-down ask, so we only had a couple weeks to build it 0→1. Our MVP was a scrappy,
              bare bones proof of concept. The seller user flow didn’t even exist at this point—the Big Brands were interfacing
              directly with our product team to setup our first couple flash sale tests, and even calling our PM on his phone on
              weekends!
              <br>
              <br>
              With no time to partner with our Visual Systems team for nicer illustrations or assets, I created <span class="bold highlight-text-p">a super simple
              storefront within the Buyer team’s guiding principles.</span> After our first test sales proved to be a success, we polished
              our UI and working closely with our brand partners and the Buyer team to build a scalable framework that could easily
              work with any brand’s submitted assets.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
              On the seller side, we wanted to build <span class="bold highlight-text-p">a new self-service flow where Big Brands could submit proposals for flash sales
              for approval</span> (instead of calling our PM on Saturday nights).
              <br>
              <br>
              This new user flow was handled by a different designer on the Commerce Manager team. This was because Big Brands
              currently don’t use Facebook app for their seller tools and instead use Commerce Manager, a whole separate web-based
              suite of tools supported by a separate team. Our teams synced regularly through this process, but I can’t quite speak in
              detail about the design decisions made here!

                                          these efforts, and to have left the team on such a happy note. I'm excited to see what Marketplace will be up to next! 😊
